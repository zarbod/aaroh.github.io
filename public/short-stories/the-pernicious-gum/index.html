<p>
It was a chilly November evening, and Marary Saina was studying for his topology final as he chewed on the last piece of gum he had left. He often chewed on gum as a stress-relief mechanism and always kept a spare pack of it at hand. This time, however, he had forgotten to restock gum in his last trip to the grocery store.</p>
<p>
As soon as he got a break from his studying, he walked over to the closest grocery store and started looking for gum. Something was off. Marary usually went for fruit or mint flavored gum that wasn&#39;t too sweet. Today, however, no matter where he looked, all he could see was sour gum. He scanned every shelf in the gum section to no avail. Being somewhat pressed for time, Marary grabbed a pack of sour gum without looking, thinking that he would come back later to stock up on more acceptable flavors.</p>
<p>
He came back home, opened the pack of gum, popped two pieces in his mouth, and went back to his desk to continue studying. After about ten minutes of chewing, Marary felt a mild sense of pain in his canines. He had expected this. This had been his experience with sour hard candy, and it was part of the reason he avoided sour candy and gum like the plague. This time, however, his need for gum had exceeded his distaste for sour acidity. He chewed on through the pain and kept working on practice problems. After about 30 minutes, the gum had lost even the final remaining dregs of flavor, and Marary was ready to spit it out and go for the next couple of pieces. As soon as he spit out the gum, a sharp, stinging pain came onto all four of his canines. The pain subsided within a few seconds, but it left Marary thoroughly shaken. He decided not to go for another piece, and continued studying.</p>
<p>
As he tried to complete more practice problems, he realized that his concentration had been completely disturbed. Something didn&#39;t feel right. He kept thinking about the gum. Though sour candy had usually caused him mild pain and trouble, the stinging pain at the end was like nothing he had ever experienced. Marary thought about the contents of the gum. Citric acid. Though citric acid was present in other commonplace foods such as oranges and lemons, Marary felt that the the citric acid in the gum was especially corrosive. Initially, he dismissed it as an irrational thought. But the longer he tried to ignore these thoughts, the more impairing they became. He kept thinking about how even though he had spit out the gum, its flavoring must have remained on his teeth. He imagined the enamel on his teeth slowly corroding away, exposing the incredibly sensitive nerve endings underneath. Just the thought of food touching those nerve endings made Marary pull his lips inward.</p>
<p>
He couldn&#39;t take it anymore. Marary jumped out of his chair and ran for the sink in his bathroom. He started vigorously rinsing his mouth with water. A minute later, he stopped and immediately started thinking about whether the water coming out of his sink was neutral. It hadn&#39;t occurred to him that the tap water might itself be slightly acidic. He ran to the nearest drugstore and came back with a pH test strip, and dropped some tap water on it, and compared the color to the provided scale. It was a pH of 6.5. Not good, he thought. He vaguely remembered hearing in his chemistry class that a pH below 7 was considered acidic. Marary started to panic. If the water itself was acidic, it clearly wouldn&#39;t be able to neutralize the acid from the gum. He tried to remember alkaline foods. Nuts, spinach, broccoli. He ran to his pantry and grabbed a fistful of almonds and started eating them. He calmed down, for the moment. He composed himself, and continued working on his problems.</p>
<p>
As the night got darker, Marary started getting drowsy. He thought that he had studied quite enough, and he decided to take a warm shower before heading to bed. Thirty seconds after getting into the shower, Marary accidentally got some of the shower water into his mouth. He suddenly remembered the pH reading from before, and at that moment the sharp, stinging pain came back to him as though he had been struck by lightning. Marary jumped out of the shower, turned off the water, and rushed to eat more almonds. At this point, he was convinced that the amount of time his teeth had spent drenched in acid was enough to have caused significant damage to the enamel of his teeth. He worried that any more acidity would lead to his teeth corroding entirely. He decided to visit the dentist&#39;s office the very next day to make sure that his suspicions were correct. He called to see if they had an appointment, and scheduled one for the morning of the next day.</p>
<p>
With that, Marary made his way to bed. He turned off the lights, pulled up his blanket, and turned to his right side in order to fall asleep. He couldn&#39;t fall asleep, though. He was restless. In his anxiety, he accidentally clenched his teeth. Sharp pain went up all four of his canines again and he opened his eyes wide. He was sure that he had irreparably damaged his teeth. He placed his index finger on his upper-right canine, and felt it dampen. He immediately turned on the bedroom lights, and stared at his index finger. His finger was drenched in what seemed to be blood from his gums. He touched his canine again, only to get another unbearable sensation of stinging pain, and more blood on his finger. He swore he had also felt his canine starting to move. He went to the bathroom, turned on the lights, and looked into the mirror with an open mouth. Nothing. There was nothing to be seen on his teeth. They all seemed to be perfectly positioned in his mouth with no signs of bleeding or movement.</p>
<p>
Marary was bewildered. He swore his gums had been bleeding and his canine nerves had been exposed and his tooth had been on the verge of completely falling off. He was afraid that he had no way of convincing anyone that this had been the case if he could not even convince himself with a mirror. With an upset mind and a shaken resolve, he went back to bed.</p>
<p>
As soon as his teeth touched each other, they started hurting again. He tried to ignore them, but the pain just wouldn&#39;t stop. He eventually decided to just keep his mouth open all night. But whenever he was about his fall asleep, his mouth would inadvertently seal shut and he would be awoken with a sharp pain. At this point, Marary was exhausted, frustrated, and sleep deprived. He no longer had the will to keep ignoring the pain. He decided to try one last thing: he got a large, thick ball of cotton, and placed it in his mouth in a way that would prevent his upper and lower teeth from touching each other. He felt somewhat content with this arrangement, and started to doze off. </p>
<p>
Soon his saliva started soaking the cotton, making it thinner and thinner. Given the cold weather, Marary&#39;s nose had gotten quite stuffy. In an attempt to breathe in more air, his mouth involuntarily opened itself and sucked in a whole bunch of air, causing the cotton to be pulled right into his throat, causing him to wake up with a start, gasping for air. Marary was startled. Being in a half asleep state, he had almost completely forgotten about his teeth. He spit out the ball of cotton and accidentally clamped down his teeth. In a sudden flash, he remembered about his teeth, and the pain came rushing back.</p>
<p>
At this point, Marary was devastated. He was on the verge of tears, and he wanted to pull his hair out. He thought his teeth were surely so corroded at this point, that even a contact with air would trigger the extremely vulnerable nerve endings on his teeth. Marary wanted to cry. He wished he had never gotten the sour gum in the first place. He didn&#39;t care about preserving his teeth anymore. He knew that they had been completely ruined at this point. He just wanted to be free of the pain. He started rummaging around his house, trying to find something that might help him. He laid his eyes on the perfect tool. The next day, Marary called the dentist&#39;s office to tell them that he would no longer need their services. However, they couldn&#39;t quite make out what he was trying to say.</p>
